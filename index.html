                    In the last decades, YouTube has emerged as a dynamic platform revolutionizing conventional media consumption.

                <h2>YouTube Gaming Past History</h2>
                <p>
                    Back in time, YouTube Gaming already established itself as a primary platform for gamers to share their gameplay, strategies, reviews, and other gaming-related content.
                    The platform saw significant developments and milestones following the rapidly evolving gaming industry. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through out years, we saw the rise of influential gaming channels and content creators who played a crucial role in shaping the platform. 
                    Channels like PewDiePie, Markiplier, and others gained massive followings, contributing to the growth of gaming as a major category on YouTube.

                <h2>The Rise of a Gaming Giant</h2>
                <p>
                    In July 2017, the gaming landscape witnessed what would be later a seismic shift with the release of the early access of Fortnite, a brand new battle-royale game. 
                    The game, developed by Epic Games, not only marked a significant milestone for the battle royale genre but also became a global sensation, captivating players and YouTube communities in ways that few could have anticipated.
                </p>
                <h4>A New Game Idea</h4>
                <p>
                    Initially introduced as a cooperative survival game, it was the addition of the free-to-play battle royale mode, released on September 26 of the same year, that propelled Fortnite into unparalleled success.
                </p>
                <figure style="text-align: center;">
                    <iframe src="plots/dviews_withF.html" style="height:400px; width:100%;" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    The battle royale genre, characterized by a last-player-standing competition in an ever-shrinking play area, was previously led by PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) but Fortnite brought a fresh and accessible approach. 
                    Its colorful aesthetics, whimsical characters, and innovative building mechanics resonated with a broad audience, attracting both seasoned gamers communities but also newcomers alike.    
                </p>
                <!-- FORTNITE VS PUBG VIEWS -->
                <p>
                    Fortnite's impact extended beyond its gameplay mechanics. The introduction in the late 2017 of the "Battle Pass" system, offering cosmetic rewards and challenges, revolutionized the monetization model for free-to-play games.
                    This innovative approach, coupled with the game's online nature, became a significant advantage. As an online game, Fortnite offered players the opportunity to explore its vast map while 
                    teaming up with friends or randomly selected players. This communal aspect allowed players to forge real social connections, spending hours immersed 
                    in the game and fostering a sense of community. Let's delve deeper into these interactions.
                </p>
                <!-- FORTNITE COMMUNITY -->
                <h4>YouTube Community</h4>
                <p>
                    Indeed, as we introduced above, gaming communities are very different from other YouTube communities. Most viewers play the games themselves and are therefore all the more involved when it comes to following the exploits of their favorite YouTubers.
                    Then some questions arise:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Did Fortnite attract pre-existing gamer YouTubers, or were Fortnite creators newcomers to the platforms?</li>
                    <li>Did Fortnite attract viewership from established gaming communities, or did it build its own distinct audience?</li>
                </ul>
                <p> 
                    To answer these questions, we proceed in the following way: We handpicked the top 5 YouTubers of all time for the game category we chose. This choice makes more sense here to have an answer to these questions, as lots of YouTubers play multiple games and can therefore attract a diverse audience. However, the ones we chose mainly propose content on these particular games.
                    However, for the research on the authors and how they behaved across the different communities, we chose to select a sample of 25 millions comments from more than 1.5 millions authors on more than 3 millions gaming videos. We then used the tags under the videos they commented on to attribute a game to the commented video.
                </p>

                <figure style="text-align: center;">
                    <iframe src="plots/top5_stats.html" style="height:400px; width:100%;" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    We can already observe that even by selecting the most famous YouTuber for each game, some games are more watched than others. Additionally, Fortnite, Minecraft, and League of Legends contain YouTubers with the best rankings. For instance, in the case of GTA, 
                    'DarkViperAU' is not as well-known in terms of subscribers, even though he is famous within the GTA community.
                </p>
                <figure style="text-align: center;">
                    <iframe src="plots/game_mean_stats.html" style="height:400px; width:100%;" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    First, when analyzing the general data of these channels, we observed that even though Fortnite YouTubers published fewer videos than other gaming channels, they still hold the highest rankings in terms of subscriber count.
                    This shows us that, in a short amount of time, Fortnite YouTubers seem to have closed the gap with strongly established YouTubers who were playing games that were already well-known.
                    But we have to be cautious; Fortnite YouTubers might be well-known today with Fortnite, but did they really start producing content when Fortnite came out, or have they been on YouTube for years?                
                </p>

                <p>
                    When looking at the join date of famous YouTubers, we observe that they all started their channels between 2006 and 2016, before the creation of Fortnite. For example, 'Ali-A' began his channel in 2006 but is now known for his Fortnite videos, even though he initially produced only Call of Duty content. The difference: he was getting 10k views before and 500k today. The same pattern repeats for other YouTubers. For instance, the most famous Fortnite player, 'Ninja,' started his channel in 2011, but like 'Ali-A,' he was playing another famous FPS game, Halo. More generally, when looking at these YouTubers, they were all already producing content, but when they switched to Fortnite, everything changed! They became real opportunity takers.

                    <iframe src="plots/fortnite_timeseries.html" style="height:400px; width:100%;" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    Now that we know that the famous Fortnite YouTubers of today are, in fact, seasoned platform creators who waited several years before gaining fame, we can delve into their communities. While these YouTubers owe their current fame to their content, creativity, and talent, it's primarily due to their communities that began following them. But who are these followers? Are they new to the platform, drawn to YouTube by the release of Fortnite? Or do they come from another well-established community?
                </p>

                <p>
                    To answer this question, we can begin by delving into the time series data. By taking all the game category time series, averaging them by game, and computing their correlation coefficients with Fortnite, we obtained these impressive results.                
                </p>
                <figure style="text-align: center;">
                    <iframe src="plots/dviews_corr_withF.html" style="height:400px; width:100%;" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Fortnite shows a strong negative correlation with Minecraft and FIFA in terms of delta views per week! Based on these correlations, it appears that a significant portion of the Fortnite audience comes from the Minecraft community. 
                    Examining the time series delta view graph from the previous question makes it clear that Fortnite and Minecraft seem to be mutually competing for views.
                    But what about the comments? 
                </p>


                <figure style="text-align: center;">
                    <iframe src="plots/tag_counts_pie_chart.html" style="height:400px; width:100%;" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, comments are the best metric to evaluate the real community for a game. While views serve as a good indicator for the general audience and success of a 
                    game, analyzing the strength of the comments community and its origin is crucial to measure the community impact. First, as mentioned earlier, we based this analysis on a sample of 25 million comments. Within this sample, we observed a high proportion of Fortnite 
                    and Minecraft comments, approximately 1,800,000 and 4,300,000 comments respectively. We then measured the proportion of new commenters under Fortnite videos who produced their first comments specifically under a 
                    Fortnite video, compared to new commenters that were already commenting on another game. 

                <figure style="text-align: center;">
                    <iframe src="plots/authors_fraction_firstcomm_fornite.html" style="height:400px; width:100%;" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>
                </figure>

                

                <p>
                    We observe a significant amount of new authors for who their first comments was under a Fortnite videos. Among the 81.2% authors that had already made a comments, what was their community? Was it similar to the Minecraft community, like the viewers?
                </p>

                <figure style="text-align: center;">
                    <iframe src="plots/common_authors_plot.html" style="height:600px; width:100%;" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    And yes, similar to the views, the majority of new Fortnite authors were former Minecraft authors. This graph, illustrating the proportion of common authors between Fortnite and other games between 2015 and 2018, 
                    shows that Minecraft and Fortnite shared almost 50,000 authors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We can also answer the question: Do active authors who engage in extensive commentary participate in a singular community, or do they contribute to various communities across different games? To do so, we selected the top 30 most active authors in our dataset and computed 
                    the percentage distribution of the games they commented on.
                </p>

                <figure style="text-align: center;">
                    <iframe src="plots/fraction_game_perauthors.html" style="height:600px; width:100%;" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    For the truly active authors, they all have a favorite game (either FIFA, Fortnite, etc.), but it is rare that they restrict their 
                    comments to one category. Except for 9 authors who have almost or exactly 100% of comments on a specific game (mostly Minecraft authors), active authors comment under a lot of other games in addition to their favorite game.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All these pieces of evidence of community 'migration' motivated us to create a compelling illustration of this story: the visualization of the behavior of gaming communities from 2012 to 2019 (in music). This visual graph clip highlights how a YouTube gaming landscape formerly dominated by Minecraft was completely transformed by the release of Fortnite. 
                    The graph nodes represent the size of the communities in terms of live comments, and the flow indicates the number of comments migrating from one community to another.

                <h4>Pop-Culture Impact</h4>
                <p>
                    Nevertheless, stopping at Fortnite's impact on Gaming Communities would be nonsense since its influence transcended the gaming world, leaving an indelible mark on mainstream entertainment. 
                    The game's iconic emotes and dance moves have become worldwide phenomena.

                    Honestly, have you ever seen a video game feature being reproduced in one of the most followed events in the world?
                    Yes, Fortnite has done it. The "Take the L" dance from its game found its way into the FIFA's 2018 World Cup Final, via Antoine Griezmann who used it as its goal celebration. 
                    By making his dance in this 1.12 billion viewers event, Griezmann had a major influence in Fortnite community development, interacting with another community: the sport one.

                    <!--This crossover illustrates what makes Fortnite so special: a video game able to blur the boundaries between the purist geek community and the mainstream pop-culture.-->
                    Fortnite's influence reaches beyond its distinctive emotes, extending into the realm of live events that leave a significant imprint on both the gaming community and mainstream culture. 
                    The game has become a virtual stage for groundbreaking live concerts featuring some of the world's most renowned artists: Marshmello, Travis Scott, Ariana Grande, Eminem, and others took place on the virtual stage.

                    These events, represent a revolutionary fusion of gaming and music communities, attracting millions of players and viewers alike while also generating an immense online buzz.
                    YouTube Gaming becomes a primary hub for reliving or catching up on these - <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/03/style/fortnite-eminem-big-bang.html" target="_blank">often very hard to access</a> - virtual concerts, contributing to a surge in views for related content, including concert highlights, reactions, and behind-the-scenes footage.

                <h2>Future Impacts on YouTube Gaming</h2>
                <p>
                    As the initial fervor surrounding Fortnite's naturally begins to slowdown, the landscape of YouTube Gaming finds itself at a crossroads, bringing questions about its future trajectory. 
                    The era of Fortnite, while transformative, has also highlighted the dynamic nature of gaming trends and the need for the platform to adapt to emerging preferences and innovations.
                </p>
                <h4>Eductional Purposes</h4>
                <p>
                    Fortnite, despite its immense popularity and impact on the gaming industry, has not been immune to the pervasive issue of online harassment. 
                    Both in-game and on YouTube, users have reported incidents of verbal abuse, offensive language, and unsolicited harassment, with content creators facing discriminatory comments, threats, and cyberbullying.
                </p>
                <figure style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/18821.jpeg" alt=" " width="75%" margin="0px">
                    <figcaption>Online gaming harassement [1]</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    More than ever, YouTube has the potential to foster positive change in addressing the issue of online abuse through collaborative efforts with organizations and associations dedicated to combating harassment and promoting digital well-being. 
                    Collaborative initiatives with these latest may include the implementation of advanced content moderation tools, educational campaigns to raise awareness about the consequences of online abuse, and the creation of support networks for users affected by harassment. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Engaging with these organizations can also facilitate the development of community guidelines that emphasize inclusivity, respect, and responsible online behavior. 
                    This proactive approach aligns with the platform's commitment to promoting positive user experiences and addressing the complex challenges associated with online interactions.
                </p>
                <h4>E-Sport and Streaming</h4>
                <p>
                    E-Sports, the competitive dynamic and rapidly expanding sector of the gaming industry, has demonstrated remarkable growth, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-esports-market-report-2023-140800513.html#:~:text=The%20Esports%20market%20size%20was,key%20indicators%20up%20to%202030." target="_blank">reaching a market value of around $1.39 billion in 2022</a>.
                    This significant valuation shows the increasing commercial viability of competitive gaming but also the explosion of its community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taking the example of Fortnite, we can mention the Fortnite World Cup 2019 that gathered more than 23'000 people in the Arthur Ashe Stadium in Queens (New York) and concurrently more than 2 millions of online viewers.
                    The event had at key a $30 millions total prize-pool, including $3 millions for the winner.
                </p>
                <figure style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="images/fortnite-wc.jpg" alt="" width="75%" margin="0px">
                    <figcaption>The Fortnite World Cup 2019. Arthur Ashe Stadium, New York.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    As the E-Sports industry will continue to grow, YouTube Gaming has a vested interest of becoming a key destination for its enthusiasts.
                    Therefore, YouTube Gaming evolution will also be influenced by advancements in the platform's streaming technology and viewer engagement features. 
                    As streaming quality improves and interactive elements are enhanced, the platform may attract a more engaged and participatory audience.
                </p>
                <!--- Twitch vs YTB -->
                <figure style="text-align: center;">
                    <iframe src="plots/wc_fortnite_timeseries.html" style="height:400px; width:100%;" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>
                </figure>
                <p>    
                    This will be a major race against given the dominance of platforms such as Twitch and the recent surge in gaming streaming on prominent platforms like Discord, Facebook (through Facebook Gaming) or even Amazon Prime.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>
                    To conclude, we discovered that Fortnite acted as a perfect springboard for Gaming YouTubers. 
                    Thanks to the virality of this fresh new idea game, many became international YouTube stars and built tremendous communities. 
                    We observed how viewers reacted to this new game, particularly finding that many who were active in the comments section of already well-established games didn't hesitate to engage with new Fortnite creators and follow them.
                    We also broadened our perspective to see how Fortnite and its revolutionizing collaborations ideas changed communities beyond the boundaries of YouTube, attracting broader communities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the fervor arround Fortnite is slightly vanishing, it has also marked the imperative for YouTube to adapt following the gaming trends. 
                    The exploding e-sports community, exemplified by the success of events like the Fortnite World Cup, presents a lucrative opportunity for YouTube Gaming. 
                    However, to secure its position the platform must prioritize innovation in streaming technology, enhance viewer engagement features, and potentially explore exclusive partnerships. 
                    On the other side, phenomenons like Fortnite also demonstates the possible poor behavior of users inside the gaming community and its terrible societal impacts. 
                    The platform's has to show commitment addressing this global online problem. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the AnalyticAvengers team will be waiting for the next Fortnite to arise, we hope that you will now have a sharpened eye on the world of YouTube communities...
