                    In the last decades, YouTube has emerged as a dynamic platform revolutionizing conventional media consumption. 
                    Whether you are a sports enthusiast looking to enjoy some player highlights, a gaming fan keeping up with events, or someone simply wanting to bake a delicious cake at home, this platform always has exactly what you are seeking.                 
                    Moreover, YouTube's impact extends far beyond its initial purpose. It has given birth to several online communities where like-minded individuals watch, discuss, and engage with content that resonates with their shared passions. 
                    These communities are at the heart of every YouTube channel, and every content creator aspires to foster a devoted and engaged audience that faithfully follows their content journey. 
                    In essence, YouTube has not only revolutionized how we access and interact with media but has also forged powerful virtual communities, making it an integral part of the modern digital landscape.

                    The gaming community has always been a major player on YouTube, with millions of channels and billions of views, bringing together a diverse audience of players and viewers alike. 
                    Many famous games have emerged from this community and how brought millions of newcomers to interact with content in regards to these games. These include Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto, Call Of Duty, Fifa, League of Legends and more recently, Fortnite.

                    Let's dive in!
                </p>


                <!-----------------------   Part 1   ----------------------->
                <h2>YouTube Gaming Past History</h2>
                <p>
                    Back in time, YouTube Gaming already established itself as a primary platform for gamers to share their gameplay, strategies, reviews, and other gaming-related content.
                    The platform saw significant developments and milestones following the rapidly evolving gaming industry. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through out years, we saw the rise of influential gaming channels and content creators who played a crucial role in shaping the platform. 
                    Channels like PewDiePie, Markiplier, and others gained massive followings, contributing to the growth of gaming as a major category on YouTube. 
                    PewDiePie is a special example as he strongly cemented his position as the most subscribed channel on YouTube, with more than 110 million subscribers as of December 2020.

                    
                </p>
                <figure style="text-align: center;">
                    <iframe src="plots/delta_subs_big_gamers.html" style="height:400px; width:100%;" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>
                    <iframe src="plots/delta_views_big_gamers.html" style="height:400px; width:100%;" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The first graph tracks the change in subscribers (delta subs) over time from January 2017 to July 2019.
                    All three channels show variability in subscriber growth, with several peaks and troughs.
                    PewDiePie's channel stands out with two significant spikes, one reaching nearly 2 million new subs in a very short period.
                    The other two channels, Markiplier and Jacksepticeye, also show spikes, but they are less pronounced compared to PewDiePie's.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second graph monitors the change in video views (delta views) within the same timeframe.
                    Again, there's considerable fluctuation in monthly views for all channels.
                    All three channels appear to have a similar pattern of views with peaks often coinciding.
                    PewDiePie's channel again shows the most considerable individual spikes in views, although not as stark as with the subscriber growth.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Both graphs display that PewDiePie's channel has the most substantial fluctuations in growth and views, suggesting viral content or external factors influencing growth at specific times.
                    The similar patterns between the channels might indicate that the gaming audience on YouTube has shared viewing habits or that events affecting one channel also affect the others due to audience overlap.
                    It is interesting to note that the peaks in subscribers do not always coincide with peaks in views, suggesting that new subscribers may not always be immediately active in viewing content or that views can increase without a corresponding growth in subscribers, possibly due to viral content being shared outside of the subscriber base.

                </figure>
                
                Before Fortnite, the gaming community was already a major player on YouTube, with millions of channels and billions of views, bringing together a diverse audience of players and viewers alike. 
                From the plot, we can see the most iconic and influential games which shaped the gaming community on YouTube between 2017 and early 2018, before Fortnite became a big success. 
                Namely, Minecraft has seen cementing its position at the top of the food chain, where channels making Minecraft content ammased millions of viewers mostly every week, constantly.

                <h2>The Rise of a Gaming Giant</h2>
                <p>
                    In July 2017, the gaming landscape witnessed what would be later a seismic shift with the release of the early access of Fortnite, a brand new battle-royale game. 
                    The game, developed by Epic Games, not only marked a significant milestone for the battle royale genre but also became a global sensation, captivating players and YouTube communities in ways that few could have anticipated.
                </p>
                <h4>A New Game Idea</h4>
                <p>
                    Initially introduced as a cooperative survival game, it was the addition of the free-to-play battle royale mode, released on September 26 of the same year, that propelled Fortnite into unparalleled success.
                </p>
                <figure style="text-align: center;">
                    <iframe src="plots/dviews_withF.html" style="height:400px; width:100%;" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    The battle royale genre, characterized by a last-player-standing competition in an ever-shrinking play area, was previously led by PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) but Fortnite brought a fresh and accessible approach. 
                    Its colorful aesthetics, whimsical characters, and innovative building mechanics resonated with a broad audience, attracting both seasoned gamers communities but also newcomers alike.    
                </p>
                <!-- FORTNITE VS PUBG VIEWS -->
                <p>
                    Fortnite's impact extended beyond its gameplay mechanics. The introduction in the late 2017 of the "Battle Pass" system, offering cosmetic rewards and challenges, revolutionized the monetization model for free-to-play games. 
                    This approach inspired by classic Season Pass proved immensely successful, leading other titles to adopt similar systems in the years that followed.
                </p>
                <h4>YouTube Community</h4>

                <h4>Pop-Culture Impact</h4>
                <p>
                    Fortnite's impacts transcended the gaming world, leaving an indelible mark on mainstream entertainment. 
                    The game's iconic emotes and dance moves have become cultural phenomena.

                    Honestly, have you ever seen a video game feature being reproduced in one of the most followed events in the world?
                    Yet, Fortnite has done it. The "Take the L" dance from its game found its way into the FIFA's 2018 World Cup Final, via Antoine Griezmann who used it as its goal celebration. 
                    By making his dance in this 1.12 billion viewers event, Griezmann had a major influence in Fortnite community development, interacting with another community: the sport one.

                <h2>Future Impacts on YouTube Gaming</h2>
                <p>
                    As the initial fervor surrounding Fortnite's naturally begins to slowdown, the landscape of YouTube Gaming finds itself at a crossroads, bringing questions about its future trajectory. 
                    The era of Fortnite, while transformative, has also highlighted the dynamic nature of gaming trends and the need for the platform to adapt to emerging preferences and innovations.
                </p>
                <h4>Eductional Purposes</h4>
                <p>
                    Fortnite, despite its immense popularity and impact on the gaming industry, has not been immune to the pervasive issue of online harassment. 
                    Both in-game and on YouTube, users have reported incidents of verbal abuse, offensive language, and unsolicited harassment, with content creators facing discriminatory comments, threats, and cyberbullying.
                </p>
                <figure style="text-align: center;">

                </figure>
                <p>
                    More than ever, YouTube has the potential to foster positive change in addressing the issue of online abuse through collaborative efforts with organizations and associations dedicated to combating harassment and promoting digital well-being. 
                    Collaborative initiatives with these latest may include the implementation of advanced content moderation tools, educational campaigns to raise awareness about the consequences of online abuse, and the creation of support networks for users affected by harassment. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Engaging with these organizations can also facilitate the development of community guidelines that emphasize inclusivity, respect, and responsible online behavior. 
                    This proactive approach aligns with the platform's commitment to promoting positive user experiences and addressing the complex challenges associated with online interactions.
                </p>
                <h4>E-Sport and Streaming</h4>
                <p>
                    E-Sports, the competitive dynamic and rapidly expanding sector of the gaming industry, has demonstrated remarkable growth, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-esports-market-report-2023-140800513.html#:~:text=The%20Esports%20market%20size%20was,key%20indicators%20up%20to%202030." target="_blank">reaching a market value of around $1.39 billion in 2022</a>.
                    This significant valuation shows the increasing commercial viability of competitive gaming but also the explosion of its community.

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Taking the example of Fortnite, we can mention the Fortnite World Cup 2019 that gathered more than 23'000 people in the Arthur Ashe Stadium in Queens (New York) and concurrently more than 2 millions of online viewers.
                    The event had at key a $30 millions total prize-pool, including $3 millions for the winner.
                </p>
                <figure style="text-align: center;">

                </figure>
                <p>
                    As the E-Sports industry will continue to grow, YouTube Gaming has a vested interest of becoming a key destination for its enthusiasts.
                    Therefore, YouTube Gaming evolution will also be influenced by advancements in the platform's streaming technology and viewer engagement features. 
                    As streaming quality improves and interactive elements are enhanced, the platform may attract a more engaged and participatory audience.
                </p>
                <!--- Twitch vs YTB -->
                <figure style="text-align: center;">
                    <iframe src="plots/Log_transformed_delta_subs_withF_timeseries.html" style="height:400px; width:100%;" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>
                </figure>
                <p>    
                    This will be a major race against given the dominance of platforms such as Twitch and the recent surge in gaming streaming on prominent platforms like Discord, Facebook (through Facebook Gaming) or even Amazon Prime.
                </p>
                <!--<h4>Virtual Reality</h4>
                <p>
                    Another potential avenue for the future of YouTube Gaming lies in the continued integration of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) content. 
                </p>
                <figure style="text-align: center;">
                    <iframe src="plots/Log_transformed_delta_subs_withF_timeseries.html" style="height:400px; width:100%;" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    As technology advances, gaming experiences are expected to become more immersive, and content creators may leverage these technologies to provide unique and interactive experiences for their audiences.
                    Fortnite truly showcased these advances opportunities through its virtual concerts that appeared as multiverses. 
                    Through innovative events and collaborations, the game has demonstrated the potential for immersive and interactive experiences in gaming that transcend traditional gaming boundaries. 
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    These events are significant advances to online communities development. It allows interactions and meetings inside the single game community, but more importantly creates ones with the Music one.
